            Being part of the Vita Vehiculum family means that we support the manufacturing of electric vehicles
            (EV). Utilizing our solar generation, Vita Vehiculum has built a new electric vehicle manufacturing
            complex right here at Sonneberg Fields. It provides the capability of building EV in a plant run
            completely off solar! It is much more efficient than any of our competitors! Please reach out via the
            Contact Us page for more information regarding our EV manufacturing.
